title: What is Commuto?

Commuto facilitates the fast and safe exchange of traditional national currencies and fiat-pegged digital currencies.

But Commuto is not just an app. Rather, it is an ecosystem composed of multiple parts:

- **Commuto Core**: A set of trustless, uncensorable, non-upgradable smart contracts for EVM compatible blockchains. These contracts hold an exchange offer book, as well as all the code necessary for offer makers and takers to complete an exchange of traditional and digital currency. This includes mechanisms for resolving unforeseen issues that arise during the swap process.
- **Commuto Interfaces**: A set of applications for Android, iOS and Desktop that allow easy interaction with Commuto Core smart contracts and seamless, private communication with exchange counterparties. These interfaces make up a peer-to-peer network across which data is shared, meaning there is no central server for malicious entities to target in an attempt to disrupt Commuto. Additionally, each user's personal information is stored only on their Commuto Interface, and is shared only with exchange counterparties. And such sharing occurs only when it is strictly necessary (such as sharing bank account details in order to send or receive traditional currency.)
- **Commuto Governance**: A smart contract for EVM compatible blockchains by which holders of Commuto's native token can vote on and execute proposals related to Commuto, such as adding support for new stablecoins, traditional currencies or payment methods, or funding research and development that will benefit the community as a whole. (Note: the Commuto Governance design is not yet implemented.)

These components all work together to create Commuto's unified user experience.

Commuto is what all financial technology should be: easy to use, fully transparent, and open to anyone, at any time, in any place.

## Why does Commuto exist?

The right to freely exchange one's own fairly acquired property is fundamental. Unfortunately, world leaders and central bankers often trample this right with reckless abandon, invariably at the expense of the world's least fortunate.

In November 2009, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced a revaluation of the Korean People's won. One hundred old wons could be exchanged for one new won, but no more than 500,000 old won (worth about 200 US dollars at the time) could be exchanged, and old won ceased to be legal tender at the end of the month. Those who violated currency exchange laws were threatened with "merciless punishment" and two accused black market currency traders were allegedly shot dead in the street by Pyongsong police. And so with the stroke of a pen, the fortunes of an entire nation disappeared. [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_won)

Throughout the 1990s, concerns about the stability of the peso led many Argentinians to hold their wealth in US dollar-denominated bank accounts. But in December 2001, they learned that their dollars weren't safe either. In an effort to cheapen Argentine exports and stop a bank run, the government froze all bank accounts for the next ninety days. Account holders could withdraw no more than a few hundred pesos per week from peso-denominated accounts, and could only withdraw from dollar-denominated accounts unless they agreed to the immediate conversion of their dollar withdrawal to pesos. [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corralito) The following January, things got worse. The peso dropped its peg to the US dollar: one dollar became worth four pesos. Additionally, all dollars that remained in bank accounts were converted to pesos, but at the old 1:1 exchange rate.
